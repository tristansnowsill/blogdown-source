Study Design and Setting: This is a case study. The effectiveness and efficiency of methods to identify and export conference abstracts presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference 2016–2018 for a systematic review were evaluated. A reference standard handsearch of conference proceedings was compared with: 1) contacting Blood (the journal that report ASH proceedings); 2) keyword searching; 3) searching Embase; 4) searching MEDLINE via EndNote; and 5) searching CPCI-S. Effectiveness was determined by the number of abstracts identified compared with the reference standard, whereas efficiency was a comparison between the resources required to identify and export conference abstracts compared with the reference standard. Results: Six hundred and four potentially eligible and 15 confirmed eligible conference abstracts (abstracts included in the review) were identified by the handsearch. Comparator 2 was the only method to identify all abstracts and it was more efficient than the reference standard. Comparators 1 and 3–5 missed a number of eligible abstracts. Conclusion: This study raises potentially concerning questions about searching for conferences’ abstracts by methods other than directly searching the original conference proceedings. Efficiency of exporting would be improved if journals permitted bulk downloads.","tags":null,"title":"Handsearching had best recall but poor efficiency when exporting to a bibliographic tool: case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590843318,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590843318,"objectID":"df8864faf7ecbd79440ce0e4cd8a5c79","permalink":"/project/tars/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T13:55:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/tars/","section":"project","summary":"A multi-centred, parallel, two group, randomised controlled clinical trial, with internal pilot","tags":["Economic evaluation","Health economic modelling","Randomised controlled trial","Physical activity"],"title":"A Trial of physical Activity assisted Reduction of Smoking (TARS)","type":"project"},{"authors":["T Snowsill","N Ryan","E Crosbie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590841009,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590841009,"objectID":"2cfe4270a08d72b1e4398c167fdd4d59","permalink":"/publication/snowsill-2020-cost-effectiveness-of-the-manchester-approach/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5212Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snowsill-2020-cost-effectiveness-of-the-manchester-approach/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Health economic modelling","Economic evaluation","Lynch syndrome","Diagnostic tests"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness of the Manchester approach to identifying Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have a longstanding interest in methodological developments in health economic modelling. This project collects these and points to any relevant publications.\nSojourn-dependent transitions Markov models are extremely common in economic evaluation, but they have a structural limitation which means it is not possible to know the sojourn time in each state (time spent in that state) and use this to determine the rate of transitions to other states.\nA typical workaround is to use tunnel states, but this is not without drawbacks.\nI devised a method for calculating expected discounted outcomes when transitions between states are governed by sojourn-dependent time to event distributions. The method uses moment-generating functions and was presented at the Health Economists\u0026rsquo; Study Group in Bristol (Summer 2018) and published in Medical Decision Making.\nProbabilistic sensitivity analysis Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is a way to understand how uncertainty in model parameters translates into uncertainty about what decision to make. It also underpins value of information analyses.\nI have submitted an abstract to the SMDM 42nd Annual North American meeting (October 2020) describing a new method for propagating uncertainty through a decision model and conducting probabilistic sensitivity analysis.\nOther ","date":1590834600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590834600,"objectID":"9a7720ab93ded477ca7dda65588867a4","permalink":"/project/advances-in-modelling/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/advances-in-modelling/","section":"project","summary":"Methodological developments including the moment-generating function method.","tags":["Health economic modelling"],"title":"Advances in health economic modelling","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590832800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590832800,"objectID":"e89c786fa4dc3c0d03bee07020239026","permalink":"/project/react/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/react/","section":"project","summary":"REtirement in ACTion: a community-based physical activity intervention to prevent mobility-related disability for retired older people.","tags":["Economic evaluation","Health economic modelling","Randomised controlled trial","Physical activity"],"title":"REACT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Janet Withall","Colin J Greaves","Janice L Thompson","Jolanthe L de Koning","Jessica C Bollen","Sarah J Moorlock","Kenneth R Fox","Max J Western","Tristan Snowsill","Antonieta Medina-Lara","Rosina Cross","Peter Ladlow","Gordon Taylor","Vasiliki Zisi","James Clynes","Selena Gray","Sandra Agyapong-Badu","Jack M Guralnik","W Jack Rejeski","Afroditi, for the REACT Study Research Group Stathi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"9dfacd04acf942970fd849b38492a875","permalink":"/publication/withall-2020-the-tribulations-of-trials/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4542Z","relpermalink":"/publication/withall-2020-the-tribulations-of-trials/","section":"publication","summary":"Challenges of recruitment to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and successful strategies to overcome them should be clearly reported to improve recruitment into future trials. REtirement in ACTion (REACT) is a United Kingdom-based multicenter RCT recruiting older adults at high risk of mobility disability to a 12-month group-based exercise and behavior maintenance program or to a minimal Healthy Aging control intervention.The recruitment target was 768 adults, aged 65 years and older scoring 4–9 on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Recruitment methods include the following: (a) invitations mailed by general practitioners (GPs); (b) invitations distributed via third-sector organizations; and (c) public relations (PR) campaign. Yields, efficiency, and costs were calculated.The study recruited 777 (33.9% men) community-dwelling, older adults (mean age 77.55 years (SD 6.79), mean SPPB score 7.37 (SD 1.56)), 95.11% white (n = 739) and broadly representative of UK quintiles of deprivation. Over a 20-month recruitment period, 25,559 invitations were issued. Eighty-eight percent of the participants were recruited via GP invitations, 5.4% via the PR campaign, 3% via word-of-mouth, and 2.5% via third-sector organizations. Mean recruitment cost per participant was £78.47, with an extra £26.54 per recruit paid to GPs to cover research costs.REACT successfully recruited to target. Response rates were lower than initially predicted and recruitment timescales required adjustment. Written invitations from GPs were the most efficient method for recruiting older adults at risk of mobility disability. Targeted efforts could achieve more ethnically diverse cohorts. All trials should be required to provide recruitment data to enable evidence-based planning of future trials.","tags":null,"title":"The Tribulations of Trials: Lessons Learnt Recruiting 777 Older Adults Into REtirement in ACTion (REACT), a Trial of a Community, Group-Based Active Aging Intervention Targeting Mobility Disability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["YJ Kang","J Killen","M Caruana","K Simms","N Taylor","IM Frayling","T Snowsill","N Huxley","VMH Coupe","S Hughes","V Freeman","A Boussioutas","AH Trainer","RL Ward","G Mitchell","FA Macrae","K Canfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"37dc357ab242fe5b2d3453b2096cc343","permalink":"/publication/kang-2020-the-predicted-impact-and-cost-effectiveness-of-systematic-testing/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4952Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kang-2020-the-predicted-impact-and-cost-effectiveness-of-systematic-testing/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives: To evaluate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of systematic testing for Lynch syndrome (LS) in people with incident colorectal cancer (CRC) in Australia.

Main outcome measures: Cost-effectiveness of six universal tumour testing strategies (testing for DNA mismatch repair deficiencies) and of universal germline gene panel testing of patients with incident CRC; impact on cost-effectiveness of restricting testing by age at CRC diagnosis (all ages, under 50/60/70 years) and of colonoscopic surveillance interval (one, two years). Results: The cost-effectiveness ratio of universal tumour testing strategies (annual colonoscopic surveillance, no testing age limit) compared with no testing ranged from $28 915 to $31 904/life-year saved (LYS) (indicative willingness-to-pay threshold: $30 000–$50 000/LYS). These strategies could avert 184–189 CRC deaths with an additional 30 597–31 084 colonoscopies over the lifetimes of 1000 patients with incident CRC with LS and 1420 confirmed LS carrier relatives (164–166 additional colonoscopies/death averted). The most cost-effective strategy was immunohistochemistry and BRAF V600E testing (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], $28 915/LYS). Universal germline gene panel testing was not cost-effective compared with universal tumour testing strategies (ICER, $2.4 million/LYS). Immunohistochemistry and BRAF V600E testing was cost-effective at all age limits when paired with 2-yearly colonoscopic surveillance (ICER, $11 525–$32 153/LYS), and required 4778–15 860 additional colonoscopies to avert 46–181 CRC deaths (88–103 additional colonoscopies/death averted). Conclusions: Universal tumour testing strategies for guiding germline genetic testing of people with incident CRC for LS in Australia are likely to be cost-effective compared with no testing. Universal germline gene panel testing would not currently be cost-effective.","tags":null,"title":"The predicted impact and cost-effectiveness of systematic testing of people with incident colorectal cancer for Lynch syndrome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EJ Crosbie","NAJ Ryan","MJ Arends","T Bosse","J Burn","JM Cornes","R Crawford","D Eccles","IM Frayling","S Ghaem-Maghami","H Hampel","ND Kauff","HC Kitchener","SJ Kitson","R Manchanda","RFT McMahon","KJ Monahan","U Menon","P Møller","G Möslein","A Rosenthal","P Sasieni","MW Seif","N Singh","P Skarrott","TM Snowsill","R Steele","M Tischkowitz","AA Sanchez","J Bolton","D Church","K Donnelly","RJ Edmondson","DG Evans","P Gollop","S Goodman","S Hodgson","F Lalloo","A Lowry","RJ McVey","T Miles","G Moeslein","A Stormoken","H Stringfellow","A Wallace","L Whyte","N Wilkinson","G Wilson","J Wilson","N Wood"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"21831556f843a2cd4274954923de0f28","permalink":"/publication/crosbie-2019-the-manchester-international-consensus-group-recommendations/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4732Z","relpermalink":"/publication/crosbie-2019-the-manchester-international-consensus-group-recommendations/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: There are no internationally agreed upon clinical guidelines as to which women with gynecological cancer would benefit from Lynch syndrome screening or how best to manage the risk of gynecological cancer in women with Lynch syndrome. The Manchester International Consensus Group was convened in April 2017 to address this unmet need. The aim of the Group was to develop clear and comprehensive clinical guidance regarding the management of the gynecological sequelae of Lynch syndrome based on existing evidence and expert opinion from medical professionals and patients. Methods: Stakeholders from Europe and North America worked together over a two-day workshop to achieve consensus on best practice. Results: Guidance was developed in four key areas: (1) whether women with gynecological cancer should be screened for Lynch syndrome and (2) how this should be done, (3) whether there was a role for gynecological surveillance in women at risk of Lynch syndrome, and (4) what preventive measures should be recommended for women with Lynch syndrome to reduce their risk of gynecological cancer. Conclusion: This document provides comprehensive clinical guidance that can be referenced by both patients and clinicians so that women with Lynch syndrome can expect and receive appropriate standards of care.","tags":null,"title":"The Manchester International Consensus Group recommendations for the management of gynecological cancers in Lynch syndrome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Markov models typically cannot represent events whose risk is determined by the length of time spent in state (sojourn time) without the use of tunnel states. DES is very flexible but introduces Monte Carlo variation, which can significantly limit the complexity of model analyses. **Methods.** We present a new methodological framework for health economic modeling that is based on, and extends, the concept of moment-generating functions (MGFs) for time-to-event random variables. When future costs and health effects are discounted, MGFs can be used to very efficiently calculate the total discounted life-years spent in a series of health states. Competing risks are incorporated into the method. This method can also be used to calculate discounted costs and health effects when these payoffs are constant per unit time, one-off, or exponential with regard to time. MGFs are extended to additionally support costs and health effects which are polynomial with regard to time (as in a commonly used model of population norms for EQ-5D utility). **Worked Example.** A worked example is used to demonstrate the application of the new method in practice and to compare it with Markov modeling and DES. Results are compared in terms of convergence and accuracy, and computation times are compared. R code and an Excel workbook are provided. **Conclusions.** The MGF method can be applied to health economic evaluations in the place of Markov modeling or DES and has certain advantages over both.","tags":null,"title":"A New Method for Model-Based Health Economic Evaluation Utilizing and Extending Moment-Generating Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Varley-Campbell","R Mujica Mota","H Coelho","N Ocean","M Barnish","D Packman","S Dodman","C Cooper","TM Snowsill","T Kay","N Liversedge","M Parr","L Knight","C Hyde","A Shennan","M Hoyle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"25dcd7cc9702c3f8b8c103a33906a84a","permalink":"/publication/varley-campbell-2019-three-biomarker-tests-to-help-diagnose-preterm-labour/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5332Z","relpermalink":"/publication/varley-campbell-2019-three-biomarker-tests-to-help-diagnose-preterm-labour/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Diagnostic tests"],"title":"Three biomarker tests to help diagnose preterm labour: a systematic review and economic evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tristan Snowsill"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

The study aimed to identify the incremental costs and consequences of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of reflex testing strategies for identifying Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer taking the NHS perspective and a lifetime horizon. Model input parameters were sourced from various published sources. Consequences were measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000/QALY was used. Results Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing was cost-effective versus no testing, costing £14 200 per QALY gained. There was uncertainty due to parameter imprecision, with an estimated 42% chance this strategy is not cost-effective compared with no testing. Age had a significant impact on cost-effectiveness, with testing not predicted to be cost-effective in patients aged 65 years and over. Conclusions Testing for Lynch syndrome in younger women with endometrial cancer using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing may be cost-effective. Age cut-offs may be controversial and adversely affect implementation.","tags":null,"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer in the UK setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Yang","J Varley-Campbell","H Coelho","L Long","S Robinson","T Snowsill","E Griffin","J Peters","C Hyde"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ef5fc854cb170fd92d0bc696999e8c00","permalink":"/publication/yang-2019-do-we-know-enough-about-the-effect-of-low-dose-computed-tomography/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5352Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2019-do-we-know-enough-about-the-effect-of-low-dose-computed-tomography/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Diagnosis of lung cancer frequently occurs in its later stages. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) could detect lung cancer early. Methods: Our objective was to estimate the effect of LDCT lung cancer screening on mortality in high-risk populations.

RCTs of CXR screening were additionally included in the network meta-analysis. Bibliographic sources including MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched to January 2017. All key review steps were done by two persons. Quality assessment used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed. Results: Four RCTs were included. More will provide data in the future. Meta-analysis demonstrated that LDCT screening with up to 9.80 years of follow-up was associated with a statistically non-significant decrease in lung cancer mortality (pooled relative risk (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.19; p = 0.62).

Given the considerable heterogeneity for both outcomes, the results should be treated with caution.Network meta-analysis including the four original RCTs plus two further RCTs assessed the relative effectiveness of LDCT, CXR and usual care. The results showed that in terms of lung cancer mortality reduction LDCT was ranked as the best screening strategy, CXR screening as the worst strategy and usual care intermediate. Conclusions: LDCT screening may be effective in reducing lung cancer mortality but there is considerable uncertainty: the largest of the RCTs compared LDCT with CXR screening rather than no screening; there is imprecision of the estimates; and there is important heterogeneity between the included study results. The uncertainty about the effect on all-cause mortality is even greater.

Network meta-analysis, including six RCTs, was performed to assess the relative clinical effectiveness of LDCT, CXR and usual care. The results showed that LDCT was ranked as the best screening strategy in terms of lung cancer mortality reduction. CXR had a 99.7% probability of being the worst intervention and usual care was ranked second. Cost-effectiveness - screening programmes are predicted to be more effective than no screening, reduce lung cancer mortality and result in more lung cancer diagnoses. Screening programmes also increase costs. Screening for lung cancer is unlikely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), but may be cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a single screen in smokers aged 60-75 years with at least a 3% risk of lung cancer is £28,169 per QALY. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. Screening was only cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000/QALY in only a minority of analyses. Limitations: Clinical effectiveness - the largest of the included RCTs compared LDCT with CXR screening rather than no screening. Cost-effectiveness - a representative cost to the NHS of lung cancer has not been recently estimated according to key variables such as stage at diagnosis. Certain costs associated with running a screening programme have not been included. Conclusions: LDCT screening may be clinically effective in reducing lung cancer mortality, but there is considerable uncertainty. There is evidence that a single round of screening could be considered cost-effective at conventional thresholds, but there is significant uncertainty about the effect on costs and the magnitude of benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations: A systematic review and economic evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Barnish","J Varley-Campbell","H Coelho","S Dodman","T Snowsill","R Mujica-Mota","D Packman","N Ocean","T Kay","N Liversedge","M Parr","L Knight","C Hyde","A Shennan","M Hoyle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"af7ba2b5a174da0ccc89ee9b4ab6c0b6","permalink":"/publication/barnish-2018-biomarker-tests-to-help-diagnose-preterm-labour/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4562Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barnish-2018-biomarker-tests-to-help-diagnose-preterm-labour/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"BIOMARKER TESTS TO HELP DIAGNOSE PRETERM LABOUR IN SYMPTOMATIC WOMEN WITH INTACT MEMBRANES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IA Tikhonova","N Huxley","T Snowsill","L Crathorne","J Varley-Campbell","M Napier","M Hoyle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"623799b7b9678bf64e4f65981ea89eee","permalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2018-economic-analysis-of-first-line-treatment-with-cetuximab/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5292Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2018-economic-analysis-of-first-line-treatment-with-cetuximab/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Combination therapies with cetuximab (Erbitux®; Merck Serono UK Ltd) and panitumumab (Vectibix®; Amgen UK Ltd) are shown to be less effective in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer who have mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and NRAS oncogenes from the rat sarcoma (RAS) family. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of these drugs in patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type (i.e. non-mutated) metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Methods: We constructed a partitioned survival model to evaluate the long-term costs and benefits of cetuximab and panitumumab combined with either FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan) vs. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI alone. The economic analysis was based on three randomised controlled trials. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: Based on the evidence available, both drugs fulfil the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s end-of-life criteria. In the analysis, assuming discount prices for the drugs from patient access schemes agreed by the drug manufacturers with the Department of Health, predicted mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for cetuximab + FOLFOX, panitumumab + FOLFOX and cetuximab + FOLFIRI compared with chemotherapy alone appeared cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s threshold of £50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments. Conclusion: Cetuximab and panitumumab were recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, for use within the National Health Service in England.

Unlike previous reviews, this was based on assessing MSI testing against best practice for the reference standard, and included CRC populations that were unselected, age-limited or high-risk for Lynch syndrome. Methods: Single- and two-gate diagnostic test accuracy studies, or similar, were identified, assessed for inclusion, data extracted and quality appraised by two reviewers according to a pre-specified protocol. Sensitivity of MSI testing was estimated for all included studies. Specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values were estimated for studies that were not based on high-risk samples. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Nine study samples were included. When MSI-Low results were considered to be negative, sensitivity estimates ranged from 67% (95% CI 47, 83) to 100% (95% CI 94, 100). Three studies contributed to estimates of both sensitivity and specificity, with specificity ranging from 61% (95% CI 57, 65), to 93% (95% CI 89, 95). Good sensitivity was achieved at the expense of specificity. When MSI-L was considered to be positive (effectively lowering the threshold for a positive index test result) sensitivity increased and specificity decreased. Between-study heterogeneity in both the MSI and reference standard testing, combined with the low number of studies contributing to both sensitivity and specificity estimates, precluded pooling by meta-analysis. Conclusions: MSI testing is an effective screening test for Lynch syndrome. However, there is significant uncertainty surrounding what balance of sensitivity and specificity will be achieved in clinical practice and how this relates to specific characteristics of the test (such as the panel of markers used or the thresholds used to denote a positive test).","tags":null,"title":"A systematic review of test accuracy studies evaluating molecular micro-satellite instability testing for the detection of individuals with lynch syndrome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Snowsill","H Coelho","N Huxley","T Jones-Hughes","S Briscoe","IM Frayling","C Hyde"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"145b9adaa55a01cd9fe4162cc99bf371","permalink":"/publication/snowsill-2017-molecular-testing-for-lynch-syndrome/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5122Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snowsill-2017-molecular-testing-for-lynch-syndrome/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Inherited mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR) genes lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), gynaecological cancers and other cancers, known as Lynch syndrome (LS). Risk-reducing interventions can be offered to individuals with known LS-causing mutations. The mutations can be identified by comprehensive testing of the MMR genes, but this would be prohibitively expensive in the general population. Tumour-based tests - microsatellite instability (MSI) and MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) - are used in CRC patients to identify individuals at high risk of LS for genetic testing. MLH1 (MutL homologue 1) promoter methylation and BRAF V600E testing can be conducted on tumour material to rule out certain sporadic cancers. Objectives: To investigate whether testing for LS in CRC patients using MSI or IHC (with or without MLH1 promoter methylation testing and BRAF V600E testing) is clinically effective (in terms of identifying Lynch syndrome and improving outcomes for patients) and represents a cost-effective use of NHS resources. Review methods: Systematic reviews were conducted of the published literature on diagnostic test accuracy studies of MSI and/or IHC testing for LS, end-to-end studies of screening for LS in CRC patients and economic evaluations of screening for LS in CRC patients. A model-based economic evaluation was conducted to extrapolate long-term outcomes from the results of the diagnostic test accuracy review. The model was extended from a model previously developed by the authors. Results: Ten studies were identified that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of MSI and/or IHC testing for identifying LS in CRC patients. For MSI testing, sensitivity ranged from 66.7% to 100.0% and specificity ranged from 61.1% to 92.5%. For IHC, sensitivity ranged from 80.8% to 100.0% and specificity ranged from 80.5% to 91.9%. When tumours showing low levels of MSI were treated as a positive result, the sensitivity of MSI testing increased but specificity fell. No end-to-end studies of screening for LS in CRC patients were identified. Nine economic evaluations of screening for LS in CRC were identified. None of the included studies fully matched the decision problem and hence a new economic evaluation was required. The base-case results in the economic evaluation suggest that screening for LS in CRC patients using IHC, BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter methylation testing would be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for this strategy was £11,008 per QALY compared with no screening. Screening without tumour tests is not predicted to be cost-effective. Limitations: Most of the diagnostic test accuracy studies identified were rated as having a risk of bias or were conducted in unrepresentative samples. There was no direct evidence that screening improves long-term outcomes. No probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Conclusions: Systematic review evidence suggests that MSI- and IHC-based testing can be used to identify LS in CRC patients, although there was heterogeneity in the methods used in the studies identified and the results of the studies. There was no high-quality empirical evidence that screening improves long-term outcomes and so an evidence linkage approach using modelling was necessary. Key determinants of whether or not screening is cost-effective are the accuracy of tumour-based tests, CRC risk without surveillance, the number of relatives identified for cascade testing, colonoscopic surveillance effectiveness and the acceptance of genetic testing. Future work should investigate screening for more causes of hereditary CRC and screening for LS in endometrial cancer patients.","tags":null,"title":"Molecular testing for Lynch syndrome in people with colorectal cancer: Systematic reviews and economic evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TM Snowsill","J Moore","REM Mota","JL Peters","TL Jones-Hughes","NJ Huxley","HF Coelho","M Haasova","C Cooper","JA Lowe","JL Varley-Campbell","L Crathorne","MJ Allwood","R Anderson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"170ebe0fbae12a70c212fcb053292d0e","permalink":"/publication/snowsill-2017-immunosuppressive-agents-in-adult-kidney-transplantation/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snowsill-2017-immunosuppressive-agents-in-adult-kidney-transplantation/","section":"publication","summary":"Background. Immunosuppression is required in kidney transplantation to prevent rejection and prolong graft survival. We conducted an economic evaluation to support England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in developing updated guidance on the use of immunosuppression, incorporating new immunosuppressive agents, and addressing changes in pricing and the evidence base. Methods. A discrete-time state transition model was developed to simulate adult kidney transplant patients over their lifetime. A total of 16 different regimens were modelled to assess the cost-effectiveness of basiliximab and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rabbit ATG) as induction agents (with no antibody induction as a comparator) and immediate-release tacrolimus, prolonged-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium, sirolimus, everolimus and belatacept as maintenance agents (with ciclosporin and azathioprine as comparators). Graft survival was extrapolated from acute rejection rates, graft function and post-transplant diabetes rates, all estimated at 12months post-transplantation. National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services costs were included. Cost-effectiveness thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per quality-adjusted life year were used. Results. Basiliximab was predicted to be more effective and less costly than rabbit ATG and induction without antibodies. Immediate-release tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were cost-effective as maintenance therapies. Other therapies were either more expensive and less effective or would only be costeffective if a threshold in excess of £100 000 per quality-adjusted life year were used. Conclusions. A regimen comprising induction with basiliximab, followed by maintenance therapy with immediate-release tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, is likely to be effective for uncomplicated adult kidney transplant patients and a costeffective use of NHS resources.","tags":null,"title":"Immunosuppressive agents in adult kidney transplantation in the National Health Service: A model-based economic evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IA Tikhonova","MW Hoyle","TM Snowsill","C Cooper","JL Varley-Campbell","CE Rudin","RE Mujica Mota"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"c7d3de4165052a473bb583f8f273e0b3","permalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2017-azacitidine-for-treating-acute-myeloid-leukaemia/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5272Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2017-azacitidine-for-treating-acute-myeloid-leukaemia/","section":"publication","summary":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of azacitidine (Celgene) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia with more than 30 % bone marrow blasts in adults who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as part of the NICE’s Single Technology Appraisal process. The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company’s submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness data used in the company’s economic analysis were derived from a single randomised controlled trial, AZA-AML-001. It was an international, multicentre, controlled, phase III study with an open-label, parallel-group design conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of azacitidine against a conventional care regimen (CCR). The CCR was a composite comparator of acute myeloid leukaemia treatments currently available in the National Health Service: intensive chemotherapy followed by best supportive care (BSC) upon disease relapse or progression, non-intensive chemotherapy followed by BSC and BSC only. In AZA-AML-001, the primary endpoint was overall survival. Azacitidine appeared to be superior to the CCR, with median overall survival of 10.4 and 6.5 months, respectively. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the survival advantage associated with azacitidine was not statistically significant. The company submitted a de novo economic evaluation based on a partitioned survival model with four health states: “Remission”, “Non-remission”, “Relapse/Progressive disease” and “Death”. The model time horizon was 10 years. The perspective was the National Health Service and Personal Social Services. Costs and health effects were discounted at the rate of 3.5 % per year. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of azacitidine compared with the CCR was £20,648 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was £17,423 per QALY. At the willingness-to-pay of £20,000, £30,000 and £50,000 per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was 0.699, 0.908 and 0.996, respectively. The ERG identified a number of errors in Celgene’s model and concluded that the results of the company’s economic evaluation could not be considered robust. After amendments to Celgene’s model, the base-case ICER was £273,308 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was £277,123 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay of £100,000 per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was less than 5 %. In all exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG, the ICER exceeded the NICE’s cost-effectiveness threshold range of £20,000–30,000 per QALY. Given the evidence provided in the submission, azacitidine did not fulfil NICE’s end-of-life criteria. After considering the analyses performed by the ERG and submissions from clinician and patient experts, the NICE Appraisal Committee did not recommend azacitidine for this indication.","tags":null,"title":"Azacitidine for Treating Acute Myeloid Leukaemia with More Than 30 % Bone Marrow Blasts: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Single Technology Appraisal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Huxley","L Crathorne","J Varley-Campbell","I Tikhonova","T Snowsill","S Briscoe","J Peters","M Bond","M Napier","M Hoyle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"52cdf733bed8a60af622db1e9a2706d0","permalink":"/publication/huxley-2017-the-clinical-effectiveness-and-cost-effectiveness-of-cetuximab/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4902Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huxley-2017-the-clinical-effectiveness-and-cost-effectiveness-of-cetuximab/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK after breast, lung and prostate cancer. People with metastatic disease who are sufficiently fit are usually treated with active chemotherapy as first-or second-line therapy. Targeted agents are available, including the antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents cetuximab (Erbitux®, Merck Serono UK Ltd, Feltham, UK) and panitumumab (Vecitibix®, Amgen UK Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Objective: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy and cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy for rat sarcoma (RAS) wild-type (WT) patients for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Data sources: The assessment included a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, a review and critique of manufacturer submissions, and a de novo cohort-based economic analysis. For the assessment of effectiveness, a literature search was conducted up to 27 April 2015 in a range of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Review methods: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or systematic reviews of RCTs of cetuximab or panitumumab in participants with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS WT status. All steps in the review were performed by one reviewer and checked independently by a second. Narrative synthesis and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted for outcomes of interest. An economic model was developed focusing on first-line treatment and using a 30-year time horizon to capture costs and benefits. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Scenario analyses and probabilistic and univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The searches identified 2811 titles and abstracts, of which five clinical trials were included. Additional data from these trials were provided by the manufacturers. No data were available for panitumumab plus irinotecan-based chemotherapy (folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan) (FOLFIRI) in previously untreated patients. Studies reported results for RAS WT subgroups. First-line treatment with anti-EGFR therapies in combination with chemotherapy appeared to have statistically significant benefits for patients who are RAS WT. For the independent economic evaluation, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for RAS WT patients for cetuximab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin) (FOLFOX) compared with FOLFOX was £104,205 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; for panitumumab plus FOLFOX compared with FOLFOX was £204,103 per QALY gained; and for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI was £122,554 per QALY gained. The ICERs were sensitive to treatment duration, progression-free survival, overall survival (resected patients only) and resection rates. Limitations: The trials included RAS WT populations only as subgroups. No evidence was available for panitumumab plus FOLFIRI. Two networks were used for the NMA and model, based on the different chemotherapies (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI), as insufficient evidence was available to the assessment group to connect these networks. Conclusions: Although cetuximab and panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy appear to be clinically beneficial for RAS WT patients compared with chemotherapy alone, they are likely to represent poor value for money when judged by cost-effectiveness criteria currently used in the UK. It would be useful to conduct a RCT in patients with RAS WT.","tags":null,"title":"The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cetuximab (review of technology appraisal no. 176) and panitumumab (partial review of technology appraisal no. 240) for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer: A systematic review and economic evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I Tikhonova","M Hoyle","T Snowsill","C Cooper","J Varley-Campbell","C Rudin","MR Mota"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"7c14fc860af489d846a27106327bb34f","permalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2016-azacitidine-for-treating-acute-myeloid-leukaemia/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.5232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tikhonova-2016-azacitidine-for-treating-acute-myeloid-leukaemia/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"AZACITIDINE FOR TREATING ACUTE MYELOID LEUKAEMIA: A NICE SINGLE TECHNOLOGY APPRAISAL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Jones-Hughes","T Snowsill","M Haasova","H Coelho","L Crathorne","C Cooper","R Mujica-Mota","J Peters","J Varley-Campbell","N Huxley","J Moore","M Allwood","J Lowe","C Hyde","M Hoyle","M Bond","R Anderson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"82d46f449fc7bfe56ca929a5579f8ad5","permalink":"/publication/jones-hughes-2016-immunosuppressive-therapy-for-kidney-transplantation/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4922Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jones-hughes-2016-immunosuppressive-therapy-for-kidney-transplantation/","section":"publication","summary":"LIMITATIONS: For included trials, there was substantial methodological heterogeneity, few trials reported follow-up beyond 1 year, and there were insufficient data to perform subgroup analysis.

Ideally, these would be sufficiently powered for subgroup analysis and include health-related quality of life as an outcome.CONCLUSION: Only a regimen of BAS induction followed by maintenance with TAC and MMF is likely to be cost-effective at £20,000-30,000 per QALY.STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42014013189.FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease is a long-term irreversible decline in kidney function requiring renal replacement therapy: kidney transplantation, haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The preferred option is kidney transplantation, followed by immunosuppressive therapy (induction and maintenance therapy) to reduce the risk of kidney rejection and prolong graft survival.OBJECTIVES: To review and update the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of basiliximab (BAS) (Simulect(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd) and rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG) (Thymoglobulin(®), Sanofi) as induction therapy, and immediate-release tacrolimus (TAC) (Adoport(®), Sandoz; Capexion(®), Mylan; Modigraf(®), Astellas Pharma; Perixis(®), Accord Healthcare; Prograf(®), Astellas Pharma; Tacni(®), Teva; Vivadex(®), Dexcel Pharma), prolonged-release tacrolimus (Advagraf(®) Astellas Pharma), belatacept (BEL) (Nulojix(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (Arzip(®), Zentiva; CellCept(®), Roche Products; Myfenax(®), Teva), mycophenolate sodium (MPS) (Myfortic(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd), sirolimus (SRL) (Rapamune(®), Pfizer) and everolimus (EVL) (Certican(®), Novartis) as maintenance therapy in adult renal transplantation.METHODS: Clinical effectiveness searches were conducted until 18 November 2014 in MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley Online Library) and Web of Science (via ISI), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Health Technology Assessment (The Cochrane Library via Wiley Online Library) and Health Management Information Consortium (via Ovid). Cost-effectiveness searches were conducted until 18 November 2014 using a costs or economic literature search filter in MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (via Wiley Online Library), Web of Science (via ISI), Health Economic Evaluations Database (via Wiley Online Library) and the American Economic Association's electronic bibliography (via EconLit, EBSCOhost). Included studies were selected according to predefined methods and criteria. A random-effects model was used to analyse clinical effectiveness data (odds ratios for binary data and mean differences for continuous data). Network meta-analyses were undertaken within a Bayesian framework. A new discrete time-state transition economic model (semi-Markov) was developed, with acute rejection, graft function (GRF) and new-onset diabetes mellitus used to extrapolate graft survival. Recipients were assumed to be in one of three health states: functioning graft, graft loss or death.RESULTS: Eighty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of variable quality, were included. For induction therapy, no treatment appeared more effective than another in reducing graft loss or mortality. Compared with placebo/no induction, rATG and BAS appeared more effective in reducing biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) and BAS appeared more effective at improving GRF. For maintenance therapy, no treatment was better for all outcomes and no treatment appeared most effective at reducing graft loss. BEL + MMF appeared more effective than TAC + MMF and SRL + MMF at reducing mortality. MMF + CSA (ciclosporin), TAC + MMF, SRL + TAC, TAC + AZA (azathioprine) and EVL + CSA appeared more effective than CSA + AZA and EVL + MPS at reducing BPAR. SRL + AZA, TAC + AZA, TAC + MMF and BEL + MMF appeared to improve GRF compared with CSA + AZA and MMF + CSA. In the base-case deterministic and probabilistic analyses, BAS, MMF and TAC were predicted to be cost-effective at £20,000 and £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Review methods: Titles and abstracts were screened according to predefined inclusion criteria, as were full texts of identified studies. Included studies were extracted and quality appraised. Data were meta-analysed when appropriate. A new discrete time state transition economic model (semi-Markov) was developed; graft function, and incidences of acute rejection and new-onset diabetes mellitus were used to extrapolate graft survival. Recipients were assumed to be in one of three health states: functioning graft, graft loss or death. Results: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four non-RCTs were included. The RCTs only evaluated BAS and tacrolimus (TAC). No statistically significant differences in key outcomes were found between BAS and placebo/no induction.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are licensed for use in conjunction with red blood cell transfusions to improve cancer treatment-induced anaemia (CIA). Objective To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ESAs in anaemia associated with cancer treatment (specifically chemotherapy). Data sources The following databases were searched from 2004 to 2013: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process \u0026 Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, British Nursing Index, Health Management Information Consortium, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites were also searched. Bibliographies of included papers were scrutinised for further potentially includable studies. Review methods The clinical effectiveness review followed principles published by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or systematic reviews of RCTs, of ESAs (epoetin or darbepoetin) for treating people with CIA were eligible for inclusion in the review. Comparators were best supportive care, placebo or other ESAs. Anaemia- and malignancy-related outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. When appropriate, data were pooled using meta-analysis. An empirical health economic model was developed comparing ESA treatment with no ESA treatment. The model comprised two components: one evaluating short-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (while patients are anaemic) and one evaluating long-term QALYs. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Probabilistic and univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Of 1457 titles and abstracts screened, 23 studies assessing ESAs within their licensed indication (based on start dose administered) were included in the review. None of the RCTs were completely aligned with current European Union licenses. The results suggest a clinical benefit from ESAs for anaemia-related outcomes and an improvement in HRQoL scores. The impact of ESAs on AEs and survival remains highly uncertain, although point estimates are lower, confidence intervals are wide and not statistically significant. Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for ESA treatment compared with no ESA treatment ranged from £19,429 to £35,018 per QALY gained, but sensitivity and scenario analyses demonstrate considerable uncertainty in these ICERs, including the possibility of overall health disbenefit. All ICERs were sensitive to survival and cost. Limitations The relative effectiveness of ESAs was not addressed; all ESAs were assumed to have equivalent efficacy. No studies were completely aligned with their European labelling beyond the starting dose evaluated. There is questionable generalisability given that the included trials were published  20 years ago and there have been many changes to chemotherapy as well as to the quality of supportive treatment. Trial quality was moderate or poor and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity for a number of outcomes, particularly survival, and evidence of publication bias. Adjustments were not made to account for multiple testing. Conclusions ESAs could be cost-effective when used closer to licence, but there is considerable uncertainty, mainly because of unknown impacts on overall survival.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence conducted a technology appraisal to update a previous guidance for the NHS in England on the use of immunosuppressive agents in adult kidney transplantation (TA85). We present the results of the systematic review conducted as part of the appraisal. Methods The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of basiliximab (BAS) and rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG) as induction therapy, and immediate-release tacrolimus (TAC), prolonged-release tacrolimus (TAC PR), belatacept (BEL), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), sirolimus (SRL), and everolimus (EVL) as maintenance therapy in adult renal transplantation was reviewed. Searches were conducted in Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CENTRAL (Wiley) and Web of Science (ISI), CDSR, DARE and HTA (The Cochrane Library via Wiley) and HMIC (OVID). Included studies were selected according to predefined methods and criteria. Outcomes evaluated were mortality, biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft function and graft loss. Included studies were extracted and quality appraised. Data were tabulated, discussed narratively and, where appropriate, network meta-analyses (NMAs) were undertaken within a Bayesian framework. For NMAs assessing the effectiveness of induction therapy, the reference treatment was no induction/placebo. For NMAs evaluating the effectiveness of maintenance therapy, the reference treatment was ciclosporin (CSA) + azathioprine (AZA). Results Eighty-six RCTs of variable quality were included. Compared with placebo/no induction, rATG and BAS appeared more effective in reducing BPAR, but the evidence does not suggest a statistically significant difference between the two treatments. None of the maintenance regimens performed consistently well on all outcomes. BEL+MMF appeared more effective than TAC+MMF and SRL+MMF at reducing mortality. MMF+CSA, TAC+MMF, SRL+TAC, TAC+AZA and EVL+CSA appeared more effective than CSA+AZA and EVL+MPS at reducing BPAR. SRL+AZA, TAC+AZA, TAC+MMF and BEL+MMF appeared more effective in improving graft function than CSA+AZA and MMF+CSA. Conclusions Despite the high number of included studies there is limited conclusive evidence on the clinical effectiveness of induction or maintenance therapies. Compared with placebo/no induction, we found evidence that rATG and BAS were more effective in reducing BPAR. With regard to maintenance therapy, the NMAs showed none of the maintenance regimens performed consistently well on all four outcomes and a great deal of heterogeneity was noted. High quality, better reported, longer-term RCTs sufficiently powered for subgroup analysis are needed.

Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian and other cancers. Lynch syndrome remains underdiagnosed in the UK. Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients is proposed as a method to identify more families affected by Lynch syndrome and offer surveillance to reduce cancer risks, although cost-effectiveness is viewed as a barrier to implementation. The objective of this project was to estimate the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in individuals with early-onset colorectal cancer in the NHS. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed which simulated diagnostic and long-term outcomes over a lifetime horizon for colorectal cancer patients with and without Lynch syndrome and for relatives of those patients. Nine diagnostic strategies were modelled which included microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRAF mutation testing (methylation testing in a scenario analysis), diagnostic mutation testing and Amsterdam II criteria. Biennial colonoscopic surveillance was included for individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and accepting surveillance. Prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (H-BSO) was similarly included for women diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Costs from NHS and Personal Social Services perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated and discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: All strategies included for the identification of Lynch syndrome were cost-effective versus no testing. The strategy with the greatest net health benefit was MSI followed by BRAF followed by diagnostic genetic testing, costing £5,491 per QALY gained over no testing. The effect of prophylactic H-BSO on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is uncertain and could outweigh the health benefits of testing, resulting in overall QALY loss. Conclusions: Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients is predicted to be a cost-effective use of limited financial resources in England and Wales. Research is recommended into the cost-effectiveness of reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in other associated cancers and into the impact of prophylactic H-BSO on HRQoL.","tags":null,"title":"A model-based assessment of the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Huxley","T Jones-Hughes","H Coelho","T Snowsill","C Cooper","Y Meng","C Hyde","R Mújica-Mota"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"574247f429662c7c557d2827c718440f","permalink":"/publication/huxley-2015-a-systematic-review-and-economic-evaluation-of-intraoperative-tests/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4872Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huxley-2015-a-systematic-review-and-economic-evaluation-of-intraoperative-tests/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: In breast cancer patients, sentinel lymph node biopsy is carried out at the same time as the removal of the primary tumour to postoperatively test with histopathology for regional metastases in the sentinel lymph node. Those patients with positive test results are then operated on 2-4 weeks after primary surgery to remove the lymph nodes from the axilla (axillary lymph node dissection, ALND). New molecular tests RD-100i [one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA); based on messenger RNA amplification to identify the cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene marker] (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) and Metasin (using the CK19 and mammaglobin gene markers) (Cellular Pathology, Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, Harlow, UK) are intended to provide an intraoperative diagnosis, thereby avoiding the need for postoperative histopathology and, in positive cases, a second operation for ALND. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using OSNA and Metasin in the NHS in England for the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes metastases, compared with postoperative histopathology, the current standard. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process \u0026 Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Health Economic Evaluations Database as well as clinical trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings were searched up to July 2012. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the evidence was carried out using standard methods. Single-gate studies were used to estimate the accuracy of OSNA with histopathology as the reference standard. The cost-effectiveness analysis adapted an existing simulation model of the long-term costs and health implications of early breast cancer diagnostic outcomes. The model accounted for the costs of an extended first operation with intraoperative testing, the loss of health-related quality of life (disutility) from waiting for postoperative test results, disutility and costs of a second operation, and long-term costs and disutility from lymphoedema related to ALND, adjuvant therapy, locoregional recurrence and metastatic recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 724 references were identified in the searches, of which 17 studies assessing test accuracy were included in the review, 15 on OSNA and two on Metasin. Both Metasin studies were unpublished. OSNA sensitivity of 84.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 74.7% to 91.0%] and specificity of 91.8% (95% CI 87.8% to 94.6%) for patient nodal status were estimated in a meta-analysis of five studies [unadjusted for tissue allocation bias (TAB)]. At these values and a 20% node-positive rate, OSNA resulted in lifetime discounted cost-savings of £498 and a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.048 relative to histopathology, that is, £4324 saved per QALY lost. The most favourable plausible scenario for OSNA in terms of the node-positive rate (range 10-40%), diagnostic accuracy values (91.3% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity, from three reports that adjusted for TAB), the costs of histopathology, OSNA and second surgery, and long-term costs and utilities resulted in a maximum saving per QALY lost of £10,500; OSNA sensitivity and specificity would need to be ≥ 95% for this figure to be ≥ £20,000. LIMITATIONS: There is limited evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of intraoperative tests. The quality of information on costs of resource utilisation during the diagnostic pathway is low and no evidence exists on the disutility of waiting for a second surgery. No comparative studies exist that report clinical outcomes of intraoperative diagnostic tests. These knowledge gaps have more influence on the decision than current uncertainty in the performance of postoperative histopathology in standard practice. CONCLUSIONS: One-step nucleic acid amplification is not cost-effective for the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastases. OSNA is less accurate than histopathology and the consequent loss of health benefits in this patient group is not compensated for by health gains elsewhere in the health system that may be obtained with the cost-savings made. The evidence on Metasin is insufficient to evaluate its cost-effectiveness. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42012002889.

In particular recent research has focused on identifying how information propagates through the Internet. This research has so far only used temporal features of observations, and while reasonable results have been achieved, there is often further information which can be used. In this paper we show that additional features of the observed data can be used very effectively to improve an existing method. Our particular example is one of inferring an underlying network for how text is reused in the Internet, although the general approach is applicable to other inference methods and information sources. We develop a method to identify how a piece of text evolves as it moves through an underlying network and how substring information can be used to narrow down where in the evolutionary process a particular observation at a node lies. Hence we narrow down the number of ways the node could have acquired the infection. Text reuse is detected using a suffix tree which is also used to identify the substring relations between chunks of reused text. We then use a modification of the NetCover method to infer the underlying network. Experimental results - on both synthetic and real life data - show that using more information than just timing leads to greater accuracy in the inferred networks.

NOAM is the data management system behind various applications and scientific studies aiming at modelling the mediasphere. The system is also intended to address the need in the AI community for platforms where various AI technologies are integrated and deployed in the real world. It combines a relational database (DB) with state of the art AI technologies, including data mining, machine learning and natural language processing. These technologies are organised in a robust, distributed architecture of collaborating modules, that are used to populate and annotate the DB. NOAM manages tens of millions of news items in multiple languages, automatically annotating them in order to enable queries based on their semantic properties. The system also includes a unified user interface for interacting with its various modules.","tags":null,"title":"NOAM: News outlets analysis and monitoring system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Snowsill","F Nicart","M Stefani","T De Bie","N Cristianini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1288569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1288569600,"objectID":"c3799828c91dbcb2119e2215726812ac","permalink":"/publication/snowsill-2010-finding-surprising-patterns-in-textual-data-streams/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4992Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snowsill-2010-finding-surprising-patterns-in-textual-data-streams/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the task of detecting surprising patterns in large textual data streams. These can reveal events in the real world when the data streams are generated by online news media, emails, Twitter feeds, movie subtitles, scientific publications, and more. The volume of interest in such text streams often exceeds human capacity for analysis, such that automatic pattern recognition tools are indispensable. In particular, we are interested in surprising changes in the frequency of n-grams of words, or more generally of symbols from an unlimited alphabet size. Despite the exponentially large number of possible n-grams in the size of the alphabet (which is itself unbounded), we show how these can be detected efficiently. To this end, we rely on a data structure known as a generalised suffix tree, which is additionally annotated with a limited amount of statistical information. Crucially, we show how the generalised suffix tree as well as these statistical annotations can efficiently be updated in an on-line fashion.","tags":null,"title":"Finding surprising patterns in textual data streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Snowsill","I Flaounas","T De Bie","N Cristianini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1285891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285891200,"objectID":"9cf02b0e926c48a4f3444485d424ba4e","permalink":"/publication/snowsill-2010-detecting-events-in-a-million-new-york-times-articles/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T12:16:49.4972Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snowsill-2010-detecting-events-in-a-million-new-york-times-articles/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a demonstration of a newly developed text stream event detection method on over a million articles from the New York Times corpus.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This feels pretty powerful.

```{r load-packages, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
```


```{r table}
storms %>%
  select(category) %>%
  tbl_summary()
```

```{r plot}
ggplot(storms %>% filter(category >= 0), aes(x = year, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of storms", fill = "Category") +
  theme_minimal()
```

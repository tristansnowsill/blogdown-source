I am a health economist at the [Health Economics Group](http://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/research/healthresearch/healtheconomics/) at the University of Exeter Medical School. My research interests are economic evaluation (particularly model-based economic evaluation) and methodological developments in health economic modelling.
